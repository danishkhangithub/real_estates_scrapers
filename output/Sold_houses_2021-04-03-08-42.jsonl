  "Description": "A stunning Grade B listed six-bedroom dwellinghouse set in beautiful grounds complete with walled garden, duck pond, and summer house, this property dating from 1779 in the lovely village Kirkton of Skene will make a truly idyllic family home.Access to Kirkstane House is via a private road from the village of Kirkton of Skene, then through pink granite pillars and along a gravelled avenue lined with horse chestnut trees, which then extends around the front and side of the house. The grand, solid mahogany front door opens into the large entrance vestibule, which leads through into the ground floor hallway. Comprised of three reception rooms, dining kitchen, utility room, and shower room, the ground floor has plenty space for family life and entertaining. On either side of the hallway, overlooking the front of the property, are the lounge and dining room. The spacious lounge features panelled walls and a striking fireplace designed by Jon Bannenberg, an interior designer for the QE2. A large window provides plenty natural light and yet the generous space has a warm and cosy feel. The dining room is similarly proportioned, easily housing a large 8-10 person dining table and auxiliary furniture with ease, and has a traditional feature fireplace with marble surround and intricate plaster ceiling.Along the hallway from the lounge is the sitting room, with lovely views and access out to the side of the property and patio. It can accommodate a range of furniture, providing a versatile reception space which could have alternative use as a play room or family den. Across the hallway is the large farmhouse-style dining kitchen and adjacent utility space, perfect for everyday family dining. Beautiful original features include the Caithness flagstone floor and granite range surround, and there are lovely views across the grounds and pond to the rear. There is a range of base and wall units in cherry wood, double oven, and room for a large fridge freezer, and the space can easily accommodate a 6 person dining table and chairs. The separate utility space can accommodate a washing machine, tumble dryer, and dishwasher, and has a sink as well as plentiful shelving. Completing the downstairs accommodation is the spacious shower room, with white WC, basin, and separate tiled shower enclosure.The carpeted stairway leads from the ground floor hallway up to the first floor. Off the landing partway up the staircase is the family bathroom, with pine-panelled walls and white WC, basin, and bath. On the first floor itself are two generously-sized double bedrooms and up a small staircase from there are a further two large double bedrooms, each with connected dressing rooms. All four bedrooms have a traditional feature fireplace and lovely views of the surrounding grounds and countryside, with ample space for all bedroom furniture. There is also a good-sized coat cupboard on the landing of the first floor.Continuing up the staircase you arrive at the second floor, with two further bedrooms and a box room. Each of the bedrooms feature a traditional fireplace and are good sized doubles. The box room is quite generous in size and could be utilised as a nursery, a small study, or a large storage space. Outside, Kirkstane House has beautiful grounds extending to 1.4 acres, including lawns, a walled garden, duck pond with charming wooden footbridge, and a small woodland area. The grounds are still part of the original croft donated by the Earl Marischal in 1539 to build the first manse on the same site as Kirkstane House. The walled garden is accessed via a beautiful wrought-iron gate commissioned from Ratho Byres Forge and features a cedar-wood summer house and listed sundial dating from 1810. The grounds attract a variety of wildlife, including red squirrels, deer, and birds, and access to Easterskene Wood is found via a kissing gate. The gravelled driveway extends around the house and provides ample space for a large number of parked cars.Kirkstane House, built in 1779, was originally known as the Manse of Skene. A Grade B listed building, it was extended in 1840 by the renowned Aberdeen architect John Smith, whose final works included initial plans for Balmoral Castle (which were completed after his death by his son, William Smith). A building of historical significance, it features in \"Gordon: An Illustrated Architectural Guide\" by Ian Shepherd. It has been a much loved home of a local family for the past 40 years, who have carefully retained and restored a number of the house's original features.Located in a peaceful and secluded spot behind the lovely village of Kirkton of Skene, Kirkstane House is only 10 minutes from Aberdeen International Airport and even less from the wealth of facilities of nearby Westhill. A hugely popular town close to Aberdeen, Westhill has Tesco and Aldi supermarkets, a Costco wholesale outlet, M&S Foodhall, a range of independent shops and casual dining eateries and take aways, a leisure centre, an opticians, medical practices and dental surgeries, pharmacies, and a veterinary clinic. Its proximity to Aberdeen city and to the A90 city bypass makes the area ideal for commuters as well as those employed at the local business parks.Please note some photo editing has taken place on selected photos.There is no Chain when purchasing this property.This property includes:Additional Information:",

  "Description": "A stunning Grade B listed six-bedroom dwellinghouse set in beautiful grounds complete with walled garden, duck pond, and summer house, this property dating from 1779 in the lovely village Kirkton of Skene will make a truly idyllic family home.Access to Kirkstane House is via a private road from the village of Kirkton of Skene, then through pink granite pillars and along a gravelled avenue lined with horse chestnut trees, which then extends around the front and side of the house. The grand, solid mahogany front door opens into the large entrance vestibule, which leads through into the ground floor hallway. Comprised of three reception rooms, dining kitchen, utility room, and shower room, the ground floor has plenty space for family life and entertaining. On either side of the hallway, overlooking the front of the property, are the lounge and dining room. The spacious lounge features panelled walls and a striking fireplace designed by Jon Bannenberg, an interior designer for the QE2. A large window provides plenty natural light and yet the generous space has a warm and cosy feel. The dining room is similarly proportioned, easily housing a large 8-10 person dining table and auxiliary furniture with ease, and has a traditional feature fireplace with marble surround and intricate plaster ceiling.Along the hallway from the lounge is the sitting room, with lovely views and access out to the side of the property and patio. It can accommodate a range of furniture, providing a versatile reception space which could have alternative use as a play room or family den. Across the hallway is the large farmhouse-style dining kitchen and adjacent utility space, perfect for everyday family dining. Beautiful original features include the Caithness flagstone floor and granite range surround, and there are lovely views across the grounds and pond to the rear. There is a range of base and wall units in cherry wood, double oven, and room for a large fridge freezer, and the space can easily accommodate a 6 person dining table and chairs. The separate utility space can accommodate a washing machine, tumble dryer, and dishwasher, and has a sink as well as plentiful shelving. Completing the downstairs accommodation is the spacious shower room, with white WC, basin, and separate tiled shower enclosure.The carpeted stairway leads from the ground floor hallway up to the first floor. Off the landing partway up the staircase is the family bathroom, with pine-panelled walls and white WC, basin, and bath. On the first floor itself are two generously-sized double bedrooms and up a small staircase from there are a further two large double bedrooms, each with connected dressing rooms. All four bedrooms have a traditional feature fireplace and lovely views of the surrounding grounds and countryside, with ample space for all bedroom furniture. There is also a good-sized coat cupboard on the landing of the first floor.Continuing up the staircase you arrive at the second floor, with two further bedrooms and a box room. Each of the bedrooms feature a traditional fireplace and are good sized doubles. The box room is quite generous in size and could be utilised as a nursery, a small study, or a large storage space. Outside, Kirkstane House has beautiful grounds extending to 1.4 acres, including lawns, a walled garden, duck pond with charming wooden footbridge, and a small woodland area. The grounds are still part of the original croft donated by the Earl Marischal in 1539 to build the first manse on the same site as Kirkstane House. The walled garden is accessed via a beautiful wrought-iron gate commissioned from Ratho Byres Forge and features a cedar-wood summer house and listed sundial dating from 1810. The grounds attract a variety of wildlife, including red squirrels, deer, and birds, and access to Easterskene Wood is found via a kissing gate. The gravelled driveway extends around the house and provides ample space for a large number of parked cars.Kirkstane House, built in 1779, was originally known as the Manse of Skene. A Grade B listed building, it was extended in 1840 by the renowned Aberdeen architect John Smith, whose final works included initial plans for Balmoral Castle (which were completed after his death by his son, William Smith). A building of historical significance, it features in \"Gordon: An Illustrated Architectural Guide\" by Ian Shepherd. It has been a much loved home of a local family for the past 40 years, who have carefully retained and restored a number of the house's original features.Located in a peaceful and secluded spot behind the lovely village of Kirkton of Skene, Kirkstane House is only 10 minutes from Aberdeen International Airport and even less from the wealth of facilities of nearby Westhill. A hugely popular town close to Aberdeen, Westhill has Tesco and Aldi supermarkets, a Costco wholesale outlet, M&S Foodhall, a range of independent shops and casual dining eateries and take aways, a leisure centre, an opticians, medical practices and dental surgeries, pharmacies, and a veterinary clinic.
